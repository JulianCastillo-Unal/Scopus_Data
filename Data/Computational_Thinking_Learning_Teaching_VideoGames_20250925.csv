Seeking to systematize a process that enables primary school teachers to teach CT through computing education in primary schools, we present the design, evaluation, and analysis of an introductory coding course for 4th-grade classes in a large Italian city, utilizing the Scratch platform. The course followed a project-based learning approach, empowering groups of children in designing and implementing simple video games, and explored the adoption of a collaborative strategy through which computing experts, class teachers, and high-school tutors proactively supported the project work. We evaluated and refined the course educational strategies by conducting an observational study and co-designing activities with the involved teachers. Then, we derived an educational model that may allow K-12 teachers and experts to collaborate in designing and implementing computing education courses that are engaging, inclusive, and supportive. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","4th-grade Computing Education; Co-design; Cross-age Tutoring; Group Work; Observational Study; Project-based Learning; 4th-grade Computing Education; Co-designs; Computational Thinkings; Computing Education; Cross-age Tutoring; Group Work; Observational Study; Primary Schools; Project Based Learning; Teachers'","4th-grade computing education; Co-designs; Computational thinkings; Computing education; Cross-age tutoring; Group work; Observational study; Primary schools; Project based learning; Teachers'","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000107537"

However, there is an agreement in the scientific literature that important challenges exist, such as keeping student engagement and the requirement of developing problem-solving skills, and not just learning the code syntax. The inclusion of digital Game-Based Learning (GBL) has shown great potential. To better understand how it can be helpful to adult learners in STEM degrees, a study was conducted on the application of two very popular commercial video games in different introductory programming courses at an online university, during the introduction of basic programming topics (CS1). The methods combined a descriptive qualitative and a quantitative approach, using a reflective journals and questionnaires, which helped students consider and express their experiences, how they interacted with the games, how the games helped them better understand the topics, and realize their personal progress and potential. Results showed that the use of these games as educational resources had a positive impact in their engagement and sense of self-efficacy, but only if some important instructional considerations are taken into account. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; E-learning; Game Based Learning; Programming Games; Self-efficacy; Video Games; Contrastive Learning; Federated Learning; Adult Learners; Commercial Video; Computational Thinkings; E - Learning; Game-based Learning; Games To Teach; Programming Game; Self Efficacy; Thinking Skills; Video-games; Adversarial Machine Learning","Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Adult learners; Commercial video; Computational thinkings; E - learning; Game-based Learning; Games to teach; Programming game; Self efficacy; Thinking skills; Video-games; Adversarial machine learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201511875"

Many researchers around the world have conducted studies to define CT, to develop CT in students, and to assess CT using various tools and paradigms. Our review focuses on the assessment aspect of CT using digital games. Typically, the assessment in CT is done using Multiple Choice Questions, Portfolio analysis, pen-and-paper methods, and games. The use of video games to assess CT skills was one of the least explored areas. To further explore this area, we did a systematic literature review on the use of video games to assess CT. The findings of our review are as follows: (1) CT skills such as abstraction, algorithmic thinking, data representation, debugging, decomposition, pattern recognition, recursive thinking, simulation, socialization, heuristic, iteration, and problem-solving were primarily assessed using digital games. (2) The reviewed articles used samples ranging from 18 to 3355 participants. (3) The sample includes elementary, middle-, and high-school and graduate students. (4) In the reviewed articles, it is observed that the time for treatment varied from a few hours to the entire school year. (5) A mixed-mode study using quantitative and qualitative methods was preferred by researchers to explore the CT aspects such as CT concepts, practices, and perspectives.

Yet, many students perceive computer science as daunting and irrelevant. Physical computing offers a promising solution to this motivational gap. It enhances intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes towards technology. Moreover, they engage students who may not identify as typical programmers and foster essential computational thinking skills. This research investigates the efficacy of employing the same educational robot in different contexts, such as music, images, colors, and simple video games, while teaching basic programming concepts. We call this approach “multi-context physical computing” to emphasize the focus on the different application scenarios. We believe that this could benefit students for two reasons. Firstly, by presenting the same concept across different contexts, learners can better grasp the essence of the concept, disentangling it from extraneous contextual associations. Secondly, catering to individual interests by offering diverse contexts may enhance motivation, consequently fostering improved learning outcomes, as predicted by the expectancy-value theory. In order to assess the benefits of the multi-context approach on learning outcomes and motivation, we will compare it to a more traditional single-context approach centered on robot locomotion in a randomized controlled study. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithmic Thinking; Educational Robotics; Physical Computing; Secondary School; Computation Theory; Educational Robots; Motivation; Music; Robot Programming; Algorithmic Thinking; Computational Skills; Educational Robotics; Growing Demand; Job Market; Learning Outcome; Physical Computing; Programming Concepts; Secondary Schools; Teaching Programming; Students","Computation theory; Educational robots; Motivation; Music; Robot programming; Algorithmic thinking; Computational skills; Educational robotics; Growing demand; Job market; Learning outcome; Physical computing; Programming concepts; Secondary schools; Teaching programming; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198662071"

PC games are available in a variety of genres, offer both single-player and multiplayer options, and have spawned an international e-sports industry. Modding communities are active, digital distribution systems are essential, and hardware can be customized. Future developments in gaming, such as virtual reality, cloud gaming, and artificial intelligence, portend more innovation in the industry. The game, Plants vs Zombies is represented by Finite Automata and it is ruled by DFAs and NFAs which describe the actions and behaviours of both the plants and the zombies and the result of their actions. In the proposed work you can notice how the NFA will be converted to DFA and vice versa due to its handy functions. Overall, ""Plants vs Zombies""is a fun and interactive way for players to explore computational thinking while learning about the complex ideas of NFA and DFA in Automata Theory.

Fast Delivery facilitates the resolution of programs because it is written in a textual programming language through a simple and intuitive pseudocode in the Spanish language. The game employs a gamified approach where users answer coding questions displayed on the screen by selecting code fragments from boxes to complete the given code. Using various associated techniques, such as gamification mechanics that will be lives and scores. And also the behavioral instruction technique that will work through visual and auditory stimuli. To evaluate the effects of the game use on learning and motivation, a study was carried out with students from a Chilean educational school. The results show that some students presented an overall learning gain, while others performed worse in the posttest than in the pretest. A motivational questionnaire based in the Self-determination Theory, supports the idea that students perceived the activity as difficult, lowering their sense of autonomy and competence, raising pressure, and thus negatively affecting motivation.

This paper presents a case conducted in an Austrian secondary school involving 23 students. The students were divided into two groups that acquire fundamental skills in programming - one group using game-based learning and the second group in traditional learning. This study aims to incorporate the serious game sCool into computer science education and compare the benefits of game-based learning compared to traditional methods. The study expresses that students within the game-based group showed lower levels of motivation for computer science compared to those using traditional methods. Additionally, the game-based learning approach resulted in similar retention of computational thinking knowledge among the students one year after the study was conducted. The findings support the idea that incorporating serious games in computer science education can lead to improved learning outcomes.

The results showed that (a) conducting GBL can foster students’ CT, and the overall effect was at the upper-middle level (Hedges’ g =.600, 95% CI [.465,.735], p <.001). (b) Furthermore, conducting GBL can improve students’ CT concepts (Hedges’ g =.916, 95% CI [.410, 1.423], p <.001), CT skills (Hedges’ g =.494, 95% CI [.389,.600], p <.001), and CT perspectives (Hedges’ g =.927, 95% CI [.039, 1.816], p <.05). (c) Additionally, game mode, teaching context, and participant characteristics have positive effects on CT. Based on the findings, it is suggested that using more unplugged games and video games, designing collaborative game activities, and tailoring approaches according to gender difference and programming experience can effectively promote CT.

Therefore, identifying the reasons for the low demand of students in these programs is important when the labor demand is so high. Based on this, a systematic mapping was carried out to identify the gamification strategies used to increase the levels of interest and motivation in programming in middle school students who are about to start their university program. The mapping was based on 652 initial papers, of which 19 were accepted as they met all the inclusion and quality criteria and had sufficient in-formation to answer the research questions. It was found that the most used technological strategies are associated with video games, robotics, and the practice-based learning technique. Most of the methodologies are complemented with gamification elements, demonstrating their usefulness in increasing student interest. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Gamification; Motivation; Programming; School; Learning Systems; Mapping; Students; Colombia; Computational Thinkings; Digital Transformation; Gamification; Middle School; Programming; Programming Learning; School; Systematic Mapping; University Programs; Motivation","Learning systems; Mapping; Students; Colombia; Computational thinkings; Digital transformation; Gamification; Middle school; Programming; Programming learning; School; Systematic mapping; University programs; Motivation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169015717"

However, two of the main entry barriers are student engagement, and the fact that solving coding problems requires a more abstract approach, instead of a purely technical one, relying on problem-solving skills. To address these two issues, this paper presents a study on the use of two very popular and highly rated computer games of the “programming” genre (named “Human Resource Machine” and “7 Billion Humans”, applied in different distance learning courses aimed at adult students (median age, 31). The results show that both were perceived as very useful during the initial weeks of the semester to complement their knowledge acquisition through practice, as well as having a positive impact in their sense of self-efficacy.

Following a STEAM approach, the workshop aimed to engage participants in age-appropriate activities that focus on CT skills through the lens of creating their own game. A web-based game design interface that allows students to code and play games as simulated on a skyscraper was developed to support the workshop's core activities. The web environment also featured step-by-step tutorials and fully functional games to promote the accessibility of the learning materials for a diverse body of students and educators around the globe. The results of the study indicated that the workshop helped students improve their CT skills and differentially influence their attitudes towards computing. In particular, the workshop experience led students from underserved community districts to lower their attitude ratings, whereas the reverse pattern was observed for students from more affluent districts. The workshop reportedly informed students' perception of computing as a profession and their appreciation of the analytical effort required for developing functional games. Qualitative analysis of artifact-based interviews indicated that students could begin to make abstractions and devise algorithms by associating variables through conditional statements while solving problems related to game development. Interview analysis also revealed that students took pride in the effort that they made during the workshop. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Computer Science Education; Game Design; Steam","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111845107"

CT is a problem-solving approach based on picking a complex problem, understand what the problem is, and develop solutions in a way that a computer or human could solve. To help in this task, Augmented Reality(AR) will provide a more engaging visual way of interaction to keep students motivated while they search for solving problems. This benefit is a consequence of the AR capability of providing a visual and dynamic representation of abstract concepts. This work investigates AR and CT concepts and the best way of combining them for training student's skills to understand software and its effects. Thus, these concepts will be explored for the construction of learning activities to explain and create analogies to understand complex concepts related to computer programs. So the focus of the paper is the introduction of Shrews, the game created in this context. The principle and the proposed architecture are detailed. At the end, there is a description of how the game works and the current state of the prototype. We believe that the immersive experience using AR and CT concepts is one of the important aspects of the game to maintain a motivational approach to students. An exploratory prototype is created to explore the topic of teaching CT skills via playing a video game. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Augmented Reality; Computational Thinking; Game; Learning Activity; Computer Games; Computer Programming; Human Computer Interaction; Interactive Computer Graphics; Students; Abstract Concept; Complex Problems; Computational Thinkings; Dynamic Representation; Game; Learning Activity; Problem-solving; Student Training; Training Students; Visual Representations; Augmented Reality","Computer games; Computer programming; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Students; Abstract concept; Complex problems; Computational thinkings; Dynamic representation; Game; Learning Activity; Problem-solving; Student training; Training students; Visual representations; Augmented reality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115881489"

We use the concept of advanced technologies to refer to the latest technological developments within the field of digital technologies, including both software and hardware developments. In this paper, we review some relevant and interesting works related to this topic of advanced technologies. We have utilized an analytical review method and have carried out the selection of didactic experiences around four categories which we have considered of relevance: computation (robotics, computational thinking and artificial intelligence), extended reality (augmented reality and virtual reality), games (video games, serious games) and educational tools (LMS, apps). With these descriptors, we have searched educational experiences that can serve as examples of good educational practices with advanced technologies. The references, which we collect, may be of interest and use to researchers or to educational professionals who are searching specific information on these topics. The main conclusion we reach is that the bibliography is extensive, and this shows the interest that these themes generate within the scientific field. Furthermore, it shows the wide range of possibilities of application of these technologies, both in formal and non-formal contexts, as well as informal experiences. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Information And Communication Technologies; New Technologies; Pedagogical Practice; Teaching Media","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122093188"

Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Early Ages; Game Learning Analytics; Interests; Intrinsic Motivation; Learn To Program; Persistence; Rewards; Skills; Video Games; Motivation; Academic Performance; Age Groups; Computational Thinkings; Early Age; Game-based; Gender Differences; Intrinsic Motivation; Video Game; Human Computer Interaction","Motivation; Academic performance; Age groups; Computational thinkings; Early age; Game-Based; Gender differences; Intrinsic motivation; Video game; Human computer interaction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114730089"

However, there is little effort to develop adaptive educational computer games for promoting students' computational thinking (CT). In this study, an adaptive computer game is introduced, called AutoThinking, that not only promotes both CT skills and conceptual knowledge, but also provides adaptivity in both game-play and learning processes. To evaluate the possible effects of the game, an experimental study was carried out with 79 students in an elementary school in Estonia. AutoThinking and a conventional technology-enhanced learning approach were used for teaching CT to the experimental and control group, respectively. Our results reveal that AutoThinking improved students’ CT skills and conceptual knowledge better than the conventional approach. It was also found that students with a low and high level of prior knowledge made higher improvement in knowledge gain using the adaptive game compared to the traditional approach, especially those students with lower prior knowledge. Finally, our findings show that the adaptive game could also improve students' learning attitude toward CT better than the conventional approach, especially those students with higher prior learning attitudes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Educational Computer Game; Adaptive Game-play; Adaptive Learning; Computational Thinking Knowledge And Skills; Computer Games; Adaptivity And Personalization; Computational Thinkings; Conceptual Knowledge; Conventional Approach; Educational Computer Game; Educational Potential; Technology Enhanced Learning; Traditional Approaches; Students; Article; Attitude; Controlled Study; Estonia; Experimental Study; Human; Human Experiment; Learning; Major Clinical Study; Primary School; Skill; Teaching; Thinking; Video Game","Computer games; Adaptivity and personalization; Computational thinkings; Conceptual knowledge; Conventional approach; Educational computer game; Educational potential; Technology enhanced learning; Traditional approaches; Students; article; attitude; controlled study; Estonia; experimental study; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; primary school; skill; teaching; thinking; video game","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091486606"

The revival of board gameplay has been discussed in mainstream media, and has drawn the attention of researchers. Yet, in the field of games studies, the conception of games as learning spaces is mostly emphasized through digital/video games. Aim: This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners. Results: Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity. Conclusion: The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Board Games; Diversity; Game Studies; Learning; Literature Review; Objective","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083514775"

Yet, it is unclear how and if the game genre of student-designed games impact CT and programming. We explore how game genre impacts CT development and programming routines in Scratch games designed by 8th-grade students using a metrics-based approach (i.e., Dr. Scratch). Our findings show that designing particular games (e.g., action, storytelling) impact CT and programming development. We observe, for instance, that CT skills develop and consolidate fast, after which students can focus on aspects more specific to game design. Based on the results, we suggest that researchers and educators in constructionist learning consider the impact of game genre when designing game-based curricula for the learning of programming and CT. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Constructionist Learning; Dr. Scratch; Game Design; Game-based Learning; Scratch; Video Games; Curricula; Human Engineering; Computational Thinkings; Constructionist Learning; Game Design; Game-based; Learning-of-programming; Modern Educations; Students","Curricula; Human engineering; Computational thinkings; Constructionist learning; Game design; Game-Based; Learning-of-programming; Modern educations; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091315595"

Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Computer Programming; Game-based Learning; Gamification; Serious Games; Video Game Design","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151110817"

Bandura defines self-efficacy as awareness of the individual’s potential and capabilities to accomplish a goal. Teaching efficacy beliefs is a significant identifier of teachers’performance and motivation in teaching the specific content successfully; however, K-12 science teachers’ CT teaching efficacy beliefs are rarely discussed. Participating preservice elementary teachers (PSET) were enrolled in an undergraduate elementary science teaching methods course during the spring and summer 2018 semesters in a southwestern state university. We administered a CT teaching efficacy beliefs survey at the beginning and end of the related unit (i.e., the intervention). During the intervention, the PSETfollowed the CTpractices by building educational robots, coding visual block-based programs, and solving puzzles in the video game “Zoombinis.” In this paper, we report the impact of the intervention on teaching efficacy beliefs of PSET. We used SPSS software to analyze our quantitative results. We performed paired samples t-test for the two teaching efficacy beliefs subscales, Personal Computational Thinking Teaching Efficacy (PCTTE) and Computational Thinking Teaching Outcome Expectancy (CTTOE), to measure if there is a significant difference in teaching efficacy beliefs. Our research findings suggest that introducing CT increases PSET CT teaching efficacy beliefs. Furthermore, based on the results of our exploratory research with PSET, we propose implications of the study for K-12 CT teaching efficacy beliefs and CT education research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102997108"

The work has been put into practice using a mixed methodology, accomplishing a time-series experiment with non-substitutive pretest measures. This information has been completed with a qualitative measurement with the student's own perception about their learning process during the development of the empirical experience. To carry out the implementation of this experimental design, the students have done a series of tasks designed with Scratch and developing a project to create a videogame based on solving arithmetic problems. The outcomes show positive results using this methodology and a useful implementation of the computational thinking as a transversal resource in Mathematics, not only improving the mathematical competence but also the linguistic.

The hypothesis behind the endeavour is that the prospect of being able to develop one’s own video game in a computer science class would make it easier for students to overcome the steep learning curve typically in place when learning to program. As a means of research, we employed chat-interviews for answering the overall research question “How do students perceive a learning sequence aimed at the development of computational thinking and coding competencies through video-game development?”. More specifically, we wanted to know whether students found the task of game-development motivating or not, which aspect or project-phase of game-development they found most motivating, most entertaining, most appealing, least appealing, most difficult, etc. Furthermore, we were interested in what students found most helpful while working with Unity, what they had learned, and which mode of learning – listening to lectures or independent work – appealed to them most. The analysis of the results of the first cycle of chat-interviews has shown that the main motivational factors were the focus on game-design and the option of cooperative work in small teams. The programming act itself using Visual Studio and C# was seen as the most difficult activity. The results of our research indicate that learners are highly motivated by the outlook of developing an interactive video game as opposed to other programming applications. Chat-interviews improved the research process by eliminating one of the most time-consuming steps – the transcription of interview data – and allowing some learners to more openly express their opinions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chat-interviews; K-12 Education; Learning To Code; Mixed Methods; Video Game Development; Computer Games; Interactive Computer Graphics; Motivation; Software Design; Students; Attitudes And Perceptions; Computational Thinkings; Cooperative Works; Interactive Video; Learning Sequences; Research Questions; Steep Learning Curve; Video Game Development; Human Computer Interaction","Computer games; Interactive computer graphics; Motivation; Software design; Students; Attitudes and perceptions; Computational thinkings; Cooperative works; Interactive video; Learning sequences; Research questions; Steep learning curve; Video game development; Human computer interaction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084171564"

Design/methodology/approach: A didactic intervention was performed for five weeks. Two student groups were taught the same computational concepts in two ways. One group was taught by constructing a video game within science content to practice science and computing curriculum while the other group constructed appropriately designed projects to practice only the computing curriculum. Additionally, the students constructed a pretest project before the beginning of the intervention and a post-test project after its end. Results were based on quantitative and qualitative code analysis and interviews from the students. Findings: VGM within science content resulted in projects with more CT skills and also supported students to effectively apply their acquired coding skills, after the end of the intervention. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest an interdisciplinary environment, such as the VGM within science content, which can effectively support CT skills development and computing curriculum. Originality/value: Although VGM has been successfully applied to teach science content, this study explored the potential influence of this learning environment on CT skills development and coding fluency.

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate how children feel and interact when using hand gestures in the context of learning tools. And this number decrease in studies about CT learning. In this paper, we explore the feedback of 29 children about their interaction by using hand gestures in a game to stimulate the CT which we called CT game. We also compare this type of interaction to touch. Additionally, we examine how both, hand gestures and touch, can impact on accomplishing of the goals of the game phases.

In this study, the Unity Game Development Environment, a widely spread tool for professional game developers, was employed for teaching secondary school students to develop their own video games. The research design for the game development activities followed a Design-Based Research approach. The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Design-based Research; Engagement; K-12 Education; Learning To Code; Motivation; Secondary School; Unity; Video Game Development; Computer Games; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Human Computer Interaction; Ignition; Interactive Computer Graphics; Materials Handling; Motivation; Professional Aspects; Software Design; Computational Thinkings; Design-based Research; Engagement; K-12 Education; Learning To Code; Secondary Schools; Unity; Video Game Development; Students","Computer games; Education computing; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Ignition; Interactive computer graphics; Materials handling; Motivation; Professional aspects; Software design; Computational thinkings; Design-based research; Engagement; K-12 education; Learning to code; Secondary schools; Unity; Video game development; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067525946"

We discuss these in our study. The course merged two major topics of contemporary education-computational thinking and learning about sustainable development. Pupils in the course were enabled to unleash their creative potential as they become creators of a meaningful game and designers of a better world. Learning was based on collaboration. We could also observe an uncommon approach to teaching and feedback based evaluation.

However, informally, we observed that students who have previous gaming experience take to programming tasks easier than those without gaming experience. There have also been recent studies that show that playing strategic video games can improve problem-solving skills which is an essential skill in program design. This chapter presents the findings of our study to identify if a correlation between previous gaming experience (game playing) and individual computational thinking (CT) skills exists. To achieve this, a survey was administered on undergraduate students undertaking an introductory computing course to collect data on their gaming history and an individual assignment on Scratch. Each projectwas subsequently analysed to determine the level of mastery of core CT skills. Cochran–Armitage test of trend was then executed on each CT skill category with respect to the coded gaming experience. The results obtained during our analysis shows a correlation between gaming experience and specific categories of the CT skills domain particularly in the area of abstraction and problem-solving and user interactivity. The outcome of our study should be beneficial as ways to leverage on students’ gaming experience in the classroom will also be discussed. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Game-based Learning; Games And Learning; Introductory Programming; Scratch Assignment; Computer Games; Computer Programming; Curricula; Education Computing; Engineering Education; Human Computer Interaction; Information Systems; Interactive Computer Graphics; Problem Solving; Teaching; Computational Thinkings; Computer Science Education; Game And Learning; Game Playing; Game-based Learning; Gaming Experiences; Introductory Programming; Scratch Assignment; Thinking Skills; Video-games; Students","Computer games; Computer programming; Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Interactive computer graphics; Problem solving; Teaching; Computational thinkings; Computer Science Education; Game and learning; Game playing; Game-based Learning; Gaming experiences; Introductory programming; Scratch assignment; Thinking skills; Video-games; Students","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009770770"

Therefore, a three-step instructional strategy is advanced for introducing students to the topic. Findings: The examples reported point to hidden values embedded in the computational algorithms and opportunities for reflecting about their role, setting the stage for critical thinking and participative design sections. Originality/value: The originality of this paper relies on framing algorithms beyond their functional orientation (the current emphasis in literature), targeting critical connotations and biases that they may imply.

Students were taught programming concepts through a science project; one group represented the function of a basic electric circuit by creating a simulation, while the other group represented the same function by creating a video game in which a player should achieve a score in order to win. Video game construction resulted in projects with higher CT skills and more primitives, as measured through projects’ code analysis.

To aid this research, a systematic literature review was undertaken to investigate what is currently known in the academic literature on where Computational Thinking and online learning intersect. This paper presents the findings of this systematic literature review. It outlines the methodology used and presents the current data available in the literature on how Computational Thinking is taught online. Using a systematic process eight hundred articles were initially identified and then subsequently narrowed down to forty papers. These papers were analysed to answer the following two questions: 1. What are the current pedagogical approaches to teaching Computational Thinking online? 2. What were the categories of online learning observed in the teaching of Computational Thinking? Our findings show that a wide range of pedagogical approaches are used to teach Computational Thinking online, with the constructivist theory of learning being the most popular. The tools used to teach Computational Thinking were also varied, video game design, playing video games, competitions, and unplugged activities, to name a few. A significant finding was the dependency between the tool used and the definition of the term Computational Thinking. Computational Thinking lacks consensus on a definition, and thus the definition stated in the literature changed depending on the tool. By considering a significant body of research up to the present, our findings contribute to teachers, researchers and policy makers understanding of how computational thinking may be taught online at second level. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Online Learning; Pedagogy; Secondary Education; Computation Theory; Interactive Computer Graphics; Academic Literature; Computational Thinkings; Online Learning; Pedagogical Approach; Pedagogy; Systematic Literature Review; Systematic Process; Theory Of Learning; E-learning","Computation theory; Interactive computer graphics; Academic literature; Computational thinkings; Online learning; Pedagogical approach; Pedagogy; Systematic literature review; Systematic process; Theory of learning; E-learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057991697"

Failure to do so have led to students dropping out of computer science programs and students being disenchanted with programming to the point that these graduates are reluctant to practice in the field. To counter this issue, problem-solving training is sometimes introduced before programming to introduce them to primary concepts of program design and programming without the complexity of syntax and tools as a hindrance. However, problem-solving skills is not something that can be developed over a short period of time. For some, it takes time, practice and effort in which semester long courses do not permit. Previous studies have shown that games can be used as educational tools in the classroom. However, video games are frequently overlooked as an educational tool in favor of serious games. In this paper, we analyze the game play of selected game titles to determine if existing video games contain activities that can be associated to each of the five core skills that characterize computational thinking within the Computer Science discipline. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Games And Learning; Video Games","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103819047"

However, research continues to demonstrate sex-based differences related to computer programming confidence and STEM-related educational and career choices - girls and women are under-represented in computer science and engineering programs and the tech-industry in general. The goal of this study was to address this gap by administering a classroom-based digital game design program in same sex girls and boys only groups. The results demonstrate the importance of explicitly targeted learning experiences especially for girls related to game design, computer programming and computational thinking. Keywords: Game design, digital literacies, game maker, computational thinking, computer confidence. The belief that youth exhibit an inherent digital affinity partly undergirds the push towards an inclusion of digital games in the classroom. Supplementing a curriculum with games is built on the assumptions that these digitally connected youth are already playing games in their leisure times and that games are somehow more engaging than the books, worksheets or lectures commonly used as teaching tools. This paper will report on a study of game-based learning that took place in Ontario, Canada in 10 different school boards, 20 different grade 7 and 8 (ages 11 to 14) classrooms, and a total of 768 student participants. The study focused on the implementation of a digital game that was developed explicitly to support physical geography concepts, Sprite's Quest. Participants were given a pre-survey which included questions related to physical geography in general and concepts reinforced in the game in particular, as well as a post-survey that asked the same questions as the pre-survey, in addition to game-focused questions. A total of 435 surveys were matched for pre-to post-survey analysis which was carried out in the software R. Results from the pre-post comparison analysis show statistically significant improvement for participants overall. This paper contributes to ongoing work that attempts to demonstrate how and in what ways digital games can be used in everyday school-based contexts to support learning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classrooms; Computational Thinking; Education; Game-based Learning; Videogames; Computer Programming; Education; Engineering Research; Interactive Computer Graphics; Professional Aspects; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Classrooms; Comparison Analysis; Computational Thinkings; Computer Science And Engineerings; Game-based Learning; High School Students; Learning Experiences; Video Game; Computer Games","Computer programming; Education; Engineering research; Interactive computer graphics; Professional aspects; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Classrooms; Comparison analysis; Computational thinkings; Computer science and engineerings; Game-based Learning; High school students; Learning experiences; Video game; Computer games","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85036464493"

Intentional linking of courses from different disciplines using interdisciplinary pedagogical strategies allows students to make those connections while developing the interdisciplinary skills which will benefit their college and post-college careers. In addition to communication, critical thinking and reasoning, and collaborative skills, it has been recently argued that computational thinking (i.e., the application of computing concepts and methods to solve problems) should also be a part of a twenty-first century liberal education for a broad range of college students, including those not majoring in computing. Computational thinking concepts and skills can help students frame problems in a variety of fields and disciplines (not just STEM disciplines) using novel strategies, and, in so doing, to become better problem solvers in their professions. At our institution, many students not majoring in computing (or a STEM discipline) take a first-year problem-solving with computer programming course (PS), which is designed for Computer Science majors, to satisfy the computer literacy/fluency requirement in their degree or to learn computational thinking concepts and skills. However, since PS is a gateway course for Computer Science majors, it is even more challenging for non-majors, resulting in high non-passing and withdrawal rates. To integrate computational thinking in required liberal arts courses, we created a general education interdisciplinary course, Programming Narratives: Computer Animated Storytelling, aimed at non-computer majors, which emphasizes creative writing and computational thinking. In this interdisciplinary course, students learn the structure of narrative, concepts of problem solving, and the logic of computer programming languages as they develop a narrative-driven video game prototype. This process helps students achieve the college-wide learning goal of making meaningful and multiple connections among the liberal arts majors, as well as between the liberal arts and the areas of study leading to a major or profession. Our findings suggest that the learning objectives and the pedagogical approaches used in the course are adequate for a broad range of non-computer majors. Performance on writing and computing assessments as well as final grades (75% of students obtained a grade of C or better) indicated that a vast majority of students successfully achieved the learning objectives. These results were consistent with student perceptions as reflected in an end-of-course survey. There is also evidence that students satisfactorily integrated creative writing and computer programming to develop their video game prototypes, making in-depth interdisciplinary connections along the way. We believe that this intentional emphasis on connections between disciplines develops the interdisciplinary skills and perspectives which are important for graduation, and it lays the groundwork for interdisciplinary thinking in the workplace. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983332125"

In this chapter, the authors propose how the development of computational literacies through multimodal writing and video game design can help guide critical and academic development in an inner-city Los Angeles public school. In a research project where high school youth designed and created (programmed) a video game about an issue significant in their lives, students demonstrated their critical computational literacies, a concept that blends the critical consciousness of critical literacy and the skills and concepts behind computational thinking. Critical computational literacy offers the ability to integrate two seemingly divergent fields. By using these new media tools, students developed a more expansive and sophisticated way to communicate their ideas. This has significant possibilities for the English Language Arts, where most K-12 state standards still relegate students' literacies to overindulgence of traditional means of reading and writing of text. In an ever-evolving culture that increasingly places more significance on visual, auditory, and textual stimuli through multimodal media on computers and mobile devices (Hull & Nelson, 2005; Jenkins, 2006; Kress, 2010), schools must educate students to critically ""read"" messages in the media, and in turn become effective producers of these tools of communication (Alvermann, et al., 1999; Margolis, 2008; Morrell, 2008).

In recent years, computational thinking reveals more and more as a fundamental skill for everyone. Observing that, the educational community has been interested in the designing of appropriate teaching and pedagogical strategies by incorporating procedures for the cultivation and development of computational thinking during the learning process. In this context, the utilization of gamification aims at activating the participation of students. In particular, a common application of gamification is the empowerment of extrinsic motivation through the integration of grading characteristics comparable with those of video games, such as points, levels, and achievements. However, the activation of external motives, while disregarding the internal ones, may lead to the declination of interest in learning. This work defines a student-centered framework for strengthening the active participation of students using intrinsic motivation for learning and develops a framework for designing educational activities. As a guide to framework application, three prototype scenarios and the corresponding correlations to the computational thinking, gamification and constructivist learning theory goals throughout the learning activities are presented. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Constructivist Learning Theory; Gamification; Learning Activities","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942753687"

Such strategies include making explicit to students the need for such a transfer, advising them to follow the appropriate course sequence, emphasizing material they need to transfer to other courses, practicing transfer by inviting guest lecturers, developing metacognitive skills, and reinforcing concepts by using them in different contexts. As the transfer of learning does not occur automatically, curricular and course design should intentionally emphasize the connection between courses. Problem Solving with Computer Programming (PS) is a required course for first-year computer systems majors, offering an ideal opportunity to establish a transfer structure. To make students aware of the connections between PS and English Composition (EG1), another required course, and to facilitate the transfer of skills, we developed a learning community (LC) linking these courses. This innovative approach to teaching computing and writing to first-year computer systems majors at a college of technology uses programming narratives as its theme. Students write and implement narratives using computer programming to develop a narrative-driven video game prototype. They use Alice, a three-dimensional animation software (www.alice.org).9,10 The LC emphasizes the importance of connecting courses in the major and those in general education. The LC builds on our previous research, which found that introducing narrative elements into problem-solving courses improves overall student performance and computer programming-related problem-solving skills in particular. This study presents best practices and lessons learned from our LC, and we present three novel strategies to integrate writing in PS courses for majors and non-majors. First, since implementation of LCs is not always feasible, to infuse narrative elements into problem-solving we developed a narrative module to help students develop narrative and writing skills that can be incorporated in all sections of the PS course. Second, we developed a series of student-assessed case studies that can be integrated in all sections of the PS course for computer systems majors. Cases studies provide a narrative context in which students learn basic constructs of computer programming such as sequencing, selection and repetition structures. Third, we created a general education interdisciplinary course, Programming Narratives: Computer Animated Storytelling, open to noncomputer majors, which emphasize creative writing and computational thinking. In this interdisciplinary course, students learn the structure of narrative, concepts of problem solving, and the logic of computer programming languages as they develop a narrative-driven video game prototype. This process helps students achieve the college-wide learning goal of making meaningful and multiple connections among the liberal arts as well as between the liberal arts and the areas of study leading to a major or profession. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941992550"

Embedding these skills in the K-12 and University curricula is necessary for training the next generation of thinkers. A widely adopted approach to doing so is through simple and visual programming languages like Scratch and engaging assignments like video-game construction. In this work, we report on an empirical study we conducted with senior undergraduate education students aiming to understand how prior experience enables students to better develop their computation-thinking skills through a Scratch-based video-game assignment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Thinking; Game-based Learning; Scratch; Video-games; Students; Visual Languages; Computational Thinkings; Game-based Learning; Professional Disciplines; Scratch; Undergraduate Education; University Curricula; Video Game; Visual Programming Languages; Human Computer Interaction","Students; Visual languages; Computational thinkings; Game-based Learning; Professional disciplines; scratch; Undergraduate education; University curricula; Video game; Visual programming languages; Human computer interaction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84910092661"

This paper presents two separate video game scripting engines focusing on nurturing computational skills that can be explored in as little as one hour. Scripting engines run code developed by students to control four concurrent players on a team; up to four teams (four different code scripts) can play in a head-to-head competition. To achieve a quick learning curve, the scripting engine only supports a limited number of instructions to define initial player qualities, movements, and game actions. Students are faced with the computational thinking challenge of mapping their game strategies into code. Successful strategies require teams to appreciate the complexities of concurrent programming to control all game players simultaneously. We have observed that students quickly learn that writing code for all team players individually does not result in a competitive match, but requires a mixture of collaboration and parallel programming to be competitive in a short amount of time. The need for more advanced control flow semantics are also motivated, since students must rewrite similar code for performing similar routines through the game simulation. The video game scripting engines have been used in two high school outreach programs and results from these events indicate that the learning objectives were met and students were engaged in the activities the entire duration by modifying their code to be more competitive. Lessons learned from the first scripting engine (Dodgeball) that went into creating the second engine (Boomtown) are also presented. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Codes (symbols); Computer Programming; Concurrency Control; Education; Engineering Education; Engines; Parallel Programming; Semantics; Students; Advanced Control Flows; Computational Skills; Computational Thinkings; Concurrent Programming; High School Students; Imperative Languages; Learning Objectives; Steep Learning Curve; Human Computer Interaction","Codes (symbols); Computer programming; Concurrency control; Education; Engineering education; Engines; Parallel programming; Semantics; Students; Advanced control flows; Computational skills; Computational thinkings; Concurrent programming; High school students; Imperative languages; Learning objectives; Steep learning curve; Human computer interaction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029087939"

Recent empirical studies underline the fact that video games may contribute to the educational process. As programming and logical reasoning are concepts that quite a few high school students find hard to cope with, alternative approaches of teaching them should be explored. The use of Rapid Digital Game Creation (RDGC) for developing Computational Thinking (ComT) skills moves away the frame from simply getting programming knowledge on a specific language, having previously spent a large amount of time in the learning of its syntax, and gives students a boost while stimulating them through the development of interesting applications. Such interesting applications are games, as they can give students the opportunity to experiment their knowledge and to develop ComT skills, while at the same time can have fun. This paper presents an approach to incorporate games, multimedia and programming in order to motivate, help understand and improve analysis, synthesis and algorithmic skills. This approach took place as part of the educational process in a high school class with children at the age of 17-18 years, during ""Multimedia"" course. According to this approach, two types of projects were used. Firstly, a simplified demo version of a well known game was presented, and students had to reconstruct it from the beginning, with the same functionality. In the second project type, the rules of the game and the description of the behavior of the various actors in natural language, along with a demo version of a new game were given to them. The students were asked to reproduce the given demo, by using the RAD environment. This paper also presents a study that came through a process of an evaluation questionnaire answered by the students. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithmic Skills Development; Games-based Learning; Multimedia Programming; Programming Teaching; Rapid Digital Game Creation; Algorithms; Computational Linguistics; Computer Games; Education; Human Computer Interaction; Interactive Computer Graphics; Multimedia Systems; Teaching; Digital Games; Games-based Learning; Multimedia Programming; Programming Teaching; Skills Development; Students","Algorithms; Computational linguistics; Computer games; Education; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Multimedia systems; Teaching; Digital games; Games-based learning; Multimedia programming; Programming teaching; Skills development; Students","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938631798"

The concept of gaming has been used intensively for recruitment into Army or Athletic programs with success [2]. Games provide an excellent environment to explore ideas of computational thinking. Based on the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) [8], 67% of US households play computer and home console video games. The trend indicates a recent increase in involvement, especially in younger generations. Since the new generation is digitally native, Digital Game-Based Learning (DGBL) is rapidly receiving more attention. The phrase ""edutainment"" (educational entertainment) is defined by the strategy of combining the methods of teaching and the interactive environment of gaming to attract students [22]. The total number of graduates in Computer Science has been decreasing compared to other disciplines. This paper deals with the innovative method of recruiting students into the CS program through online gaming. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Science; Gaming Industry; Higher Education; Nsf; Online Game; Recruiting; Gaming Industry; Higher Education; Nsf; Online Game; Recruiting; Computer Science; Computers; Game Theory; Students; Education Computing","Gaming industry; Higher education; NSF; Online game; Recruiting; Computer science; Computers; Game theory; Students; Education computing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-62649093006"
